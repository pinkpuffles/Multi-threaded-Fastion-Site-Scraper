Multi-threaded-Fashion-site-scraper
This scraper employs Beautiful Soup and Selenium to scrape Products' information on fashion site JNY (Jones New York).
With the help of multi-threading, it scrapes 5 pages at once. This number can be increased or decreased. 
It scrapes Product's images, colors, recommendations stated against product, title, description and product_url and saves all the information in a CSV file. 
Code for this scraper is generic and all the functions are decoupled. If any other site is needed to be scraped then only the xpaths in each function need to be changed.
